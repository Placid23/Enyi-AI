To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## AI Strategy and Safety

This application employs several strategies to enhance the AI's capabilities, safety, and ability to learn over time.

### Feedback Loops
The application includes a system for users to provide feedback (positive or negative, with optional corrections) on AI responses. This is handled by the `src/ai/flows/process-user-feedback.ts` flow. This feedback is logged and is crucial for:
-   **Safety Monitoring:** Identifying and addressing instances of harmful, biased, or incorrect AI behavior.
-   **Iterative Improvement:** Understanding areas where the AI performs well or poorly.
-   **Dataset Creation:** This collected feedback can form a valuable dataset for further model training, such as fine-tuning or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).

### Memory and Context (Embeddings & Vector Databases)
To provide the AI with a more persistent memory and access to a broader context beyond the immediate conversation:
-   **Short-Term Context:** The `generateHumanLikeResponse` flow receives recent conversation history (`knowledgeBase`) to maintain the immediate flow of dialogue.
-   **Long-Term / Broader Context (Conceptual):** We have a conceptual implementation for retrieving broader context using embeddings, simulated by the `src/ai/flows/retrieve-context-with-embeddings.ts` flow. In a complete system, this flow would:
    1.  Generate an embedding for the user's query (e.g., using a model like `text-embedding-004`).
    2.  Query a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB) containing embeddings of relevant documents, past conversations, or other knowledge sources.
    3.  Return the most semantically similar text snippets.
-   The `generateHumanLikeResponse` flow is designed to utilize this retrieved context alongside the immediate conversation history, allowing for more informed and knowledgeable responses.

### Fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)
-   **Fine-tuning:** Adapting a pre-trained model to perform better on specific tasks or domains (e.g., legal, medical, coding, or this application's specific style) by training it further on a smaller, domain-specific dataset. The feedback collected via `processUserFeedback` can contribute to such datasets.
-   **RLHF:** A technique to align AI models more closely with human preferences and instructions. It involves training a reward model based on human feedback (e.g., rankings of different AI responses) and then using reinforcement learning to optimize the AI's policy to maximize rewards from this model.
-   Both fine-tuning and RLHF are primarily model training and development processes that occur external to this application's direct operational codebase. However, the infrastructure for collecting feedback within this app is a key enabler for these advanced techniques.

### Red-Teaming
Red-teaming is an essential, ongoing practice involving adversarial testing of the AI system. The goal is to proactively:
-   Identify potential safety risks, vulnerabilities, and failure modes.
-   Discover ways the AI might generate harmful, biased, or unintended outputs.
-   Test the robustness of safety filters and alignment techniques.
This is a procedural aspect of the AI development lifecycle, often involving a dedicated team trying to "break" the AI in controlled ways to improve its safety and reliability.
